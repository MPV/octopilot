If you are doing Gitops with GitHub-hosted repositories, Octopilot is your swiss army knife to propagate changes in your infrastructure.
Features written in Go, and has 0 dependencies - not even git native support for manipulating YAML or JSON files - which are commonly used in the Gitops world to describe resources native support for manipulating files encrypted with sops - because who wants to store non-encrypted sensitive data in git?</description></item></channel></rss>
